      Acceptance of the Terms of Service

  %p
    Welcome to NetworkMill! (a.k.a. "we" or "us" or the "Company"). We are excited to have you as a user and member of our community. The following terms and conditions (collectively, these "Terms of Service") apply to your use of www.NetworkMill.com, including any content, functionality and services offered on or via NetworkMill.com (the "Website"). The Terms of Service also include our Privacy Policy, which you can review here: http://www.networkmill.com/privacy-policy.

  %p
    We want to keep our relationship with you as lean and informal as possible, but please read the Terms of Service carefully before you start using NetworkMill, because by using the Website you accept and agree to be bound and abide by these Terms of Service. Should you disagree with some of the provisions herein, you can either leave the Website (although we'll be sad to see you go!), or contact us at hi@networkmill.com.

  %p
    NetworkMill is all about staying in touch with the interesting people you meet, and we'd be happy to hear your comments and suggestions.

      Changes to the Terms of Service and the Website

  %p
    NetworkMill is a work in progress, meaning that a lot will change in the near future. We reserve the right to update the Website and these Terms of Service from time to time, at our discretion and without notice. Nevertheless, this document is public on NetworkMill, and you will be able to track the changes for any new version. Your continued use of the Website following the publishing of updated Terms of Service means that you accept and agree to the changes.

      Accessing the Website, Security and Privacy

  %p
    We are working hard on improving NetworkMill, but we can't guarantee that the Website will be up and running 24/7. We also reserve the right to suspend or restrict access to some features to users. In any case, we will not be liable if, for any reason, all or any part of the Website is unavailable at any time or for any period, nor for any data loss.

  %p
    To access the features of the Website you have to register by entering your email and choosing a password as part of our security procedures. You must treat such information as confidential, not disclosing it to any third party and only using it on NetworkMill. Please do not share your private login information and do not use the same password you use on other websites. There is a password-reset procedure in case you forget your password, but please notify us of any breach of security. We highly recommend you choose a strong password (e.g. "correcthorsebatterystaple") and you log out from your account at the end of every session.

  %p
    As custom for internet websites, we reserve the right to disable any user account, at any time in our sole discretion for any or no reason, including, if in our opinion you have failed to comply with any provision of these Terms of Service. This is unlikely to happen, however, our lawyer insisted on us saying this.

  %p
    We do not guarantee that the Website or any content provided on the Website is error free. We manage your personal data according to our Privacy Policy, which you can review in detail here: http://www.networkmill.com/privacy-policy.

# To Do
- Note to Jeff: Sir, rollback migrations and re-migrate. I defaulted User.desktop_client => false
- Talk with Jeff to make sure that all users/contacts security is set up properly
- Randomize contact_bucket? 
- When a user changes email, update omniauth user email
- Look at identities and contact routes

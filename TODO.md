# To Do
- From Devise "Ensure you have defined default url options in your environments files. Here is an example of default_url_options appropriate for a development environment in config/environments/development.rb: config.action_mailer.default_url_options = { :host => 'localhost:3000' } In production, :host should be set to the actual host of your application."
- Look over any potential security holes
- Create mailer part
- Finish building the contact rotations logic
- Set up app to allow users to reset password (with Devise)

# To Do
- Talk with Jeff to make sure that all users/contacts security is set up properly
- Look at identities and contact routes
- From Devise "Ensure you have defined default url options in your environments files. Here is an example of default_url_options appropriate for a development environment in config/environments/development.rb: config.action_mailer.default_url_options = { :host => 'localhost:3000' } In production, :host should be set to the actual host of your application."
- Add validation to contact email
- Add user default contact_intensity

# To Do
- Note to Jeff: Sir, rollback migrations and re-migrate. I defaulted User.desktop_client => false
- Talk with Jeff to make sure that all users/contacts security is set up properly
- Randomize contact_bucket? 
- When a user changes email, update omniauth user email
- Look at identities and contact routes
- From Devise "Ensure you have defined default url options in your environments files. Here is an example of default_url_options appropriate for a development environment in config/environments/development.rb: config.action_mailer.default_url_options = { :host => 'localhost:3000' } In production, :host should be set to the actual host of your application."
